# IntelliDent: Intelligent Robotic System for Dental Caries Removal 
---

## Overview

**IntelliDent** addresses the critical need for precision in dental caries removal. The project employs a custom reinforcement learning (RL)-based trajectory planning algorithm designed to optimize the robotic path for removing decayed tissue while preserving healthy enamel and dentin. IntelliDentâ€™s high-fidelity simulations and dynamic path-planning strategies aim to revolutionize the precision and safety of dental robotic surgery.

## Key Features

- **Custom RL-Based Trajectory Planning**: Tailored to dental applications, generating optimized paths for caries removal.
- **3D Simulation Environment**: Built with Open3D, Nibabel, and Trimesh for realistic modeling of dental anatomy.
- **Collision Detection and Safety**: Implemented collision checks and adaptive navigation for safe and precise operation.
- **Dynamic Observation and Action Spaces**: Developed with Gymnasium, allowing flexible and adaptable robotic behavior within complex environments.
